# Monopoly
A 2D Monopoly game developed using the JavaFx library. In this project, I used various object-oriented methodologies such as inheritance and polymorphism to mimick the real-life
experience of a Monopoly game with auctions, community chest and chance cards, trades between players, mortgaging properties, and all the rules found in the actual game!
